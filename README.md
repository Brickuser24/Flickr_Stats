# Flickr_Stats
Get flickr stats for a user by entering their user id. Includes their total faves, total views, total comments and followers.

Enter the flickr ID in the variable in main.py and run the code.

Use https://www.webfx.com/tools/idgettr/ if the flickr page has a name in the link instead of the users' flickr ID.
